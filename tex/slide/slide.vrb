		In Python \textbf{is not possible to define multiple constructor} for a class, still is possible to define a default value if one is not passed.

		\begin{lstlisting}
		class Parrot():
			def __init__(self, name = "Perry"):
				self.name = name

		bird1 = Parrot()
		bird2 = Parrot("Jack")

		print(bird1.name)
		print(bird2.name)
		\end{lstlisting}
		The output would be:\\
		"Perry"\\
		"Jack"
